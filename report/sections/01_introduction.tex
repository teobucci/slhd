\section{Introduction}

\gls{hf} is a prevalent condition with high re-admission rates: the literature\footcite{Bragazzi2021Burden} states that the number of \gls{hf} cases worldwide almost doubled from 33.5 million in 1990 to 64.3 million in 2017.

Studies\footcite{Groenewegen2020Epidemiology} also suggest that half of the patients diagnosed with \gls{hf} will be re-admitted once within a year and 20\% will be re-admitted twice or more. The focus of this analysis is on predicting the re-admission within 6 months for \gls{hf} patients.

However, our emphasis extends beyond prediction performance; we prioritize the development of an interpretable model that healthcare professionals can easily understand. By examining patient characteristics and clinical variables, we aim to identify key predictors and provide valuable insights for targeted interventions and personalized care plans.
